## Building the project

Install `flatpak`, `flatpak-builder`, and [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).

```shell
dnf install pre-commit
```

Or, alternatively, install pre-commit with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```shell
uv tool install pre-commit
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

To build a local development release, run:

```shell
just devel
```

## Roadmap
Aspirationally, this is what I want to add to Fotema.

* Machine learning.
	* Face detection and person recognition, supporting features such as naming a face and then generating an album of all faces that are similar. Preferably in pure Rust, but needs be as needs must.
	* Object and animal recognition.
	* Text recognition, supporting such features as copying text out of a photo or searching for photos containing particular text.
* Search by recognized items, such as "all photos of Sven with a dog".
* A dashboard page showcasing people, places, and events.
* Swipe and keyboard support for the photo/video viewer.
* Fewer (preferably zero) Flatpak permissions.
